## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](./public/app_images/play_won.png)

<a href="https://paconavarrete.github.io/tic-tac-toe-animated/" target="_blank">Play the game here!</a>

This project is a tic-tac-toe game using useContext + useReducer hooks, the theme of the game is a confrontation between the taco and hamburger foods.

Here's why:

- I live in Mexico now and I love the Tacos of carne asada (roast beef) and adobada (marinated beef), and let's not be hungry for foodsea Tacos, mmmm... delicious!
- Even in Mexico we have a lot hamburger restaurant and they are also pretty nice.
- I want to play a different theme, I'm bored with the circles and crosses.
- You can play it and if don't like Tacos or burgers you can forke it and change it.
